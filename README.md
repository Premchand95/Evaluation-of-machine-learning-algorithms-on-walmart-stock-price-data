# Evaluation-of-machine-learning-algorithms-on-walmart-stock-price-data
CSCI 54900 INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS PROJECT

## Description

* Item Implemented Min-Max Normalization on Walmart data â€“ scaled the data to fixed range
* Item Feature selection is implemented to get weighed variables using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
* Item Recursive Neural Networks (RNN), AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) Machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models respectively.
* Item In performance analysis, Confusion matrix and root mean squared error (RSME) is used to evaluate prediction models.
* Item Among all the algorithms used ARIMA shows least error rate.

### Feature Selection
**we got "High", "Low" , "Open" as top features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**


### Recurrent Neural Networks

### ARIMA

### SVM

### Results
* **Forecast of walmart data for next 5 days using ARIMA**
