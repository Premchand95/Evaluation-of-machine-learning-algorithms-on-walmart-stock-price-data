# Evaluation-of-machine-learning-algorithms-on-walmart-stock-price-data
CSCI 54900 INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS PROJECT

### Description
```
•	Implemented Min-Max Normalization on Walmart data – scaled the data to fixed range
•	Feature selection is implemented to get weighed variables using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
•	Recursive Neural Networks (RNN), AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) Machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models respectively.
•	In performance analysis, Confusion matrix and root mean squared error (RSME) is used to evaluate prediction models.
•	Among all the algorithms used ARIMA shows least error rate.
